Effective Date: [Effective Date, e.g., May 27, 2025]

Welcome to [DIYManager] (the "App"), operated by Kevin Taniguchi ("we," "us," or "our"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our App and the services, features, content, or applications offered by us (collectively, the "Services").

Please read these Terms carefully before using the App. By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy (available at https://www.privacypolicies.com/live/0ef3c708-2eed-4cf0-9f11-3799b6262e0f), which is incorporated herein by reference. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the App.

1. Description of Service
[DIYManager] is a mobile application designed to help users plan, organize, track, and manage personal Do-It-Yourself (DIY) projects, including but not limited to home improvement, renovation, crafting, and gardening. Features include project creation, task management, budget and expense tracking, material and shopping list management, photo and note organization, and optional AI-powered assistance features.

2. User Accounts & Apple ID
Access to certain features of the App, including premium subscriptions and iCloud/CloudKit synchronization, requires an active Apple ID and is subject to Apple's terms and conditions for App Store purchases and iCloud services. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Apple ID and for all activities that occur under your account.

3. License to Use the App
We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to download, install, and use the App for your personal, non-commercial use on iOS devices that you own or control, strictly in accordance with these Terms.

4. Freemium Service & Premium Subscription

Free Tier: The App offers a free tier of service ("Free Tier") which allows users to manage a limited number of active projects (e.g., up to two (2) active projects) and access core planning features within those projects. The specific limitations of the Free Tier may be adjusted by us from time to time.

Premium Subscription: We offer a premium subscription ("Premium Subscription," e.g., "[App Name] Premium - Annual") which unlocks additional features and removes certain limitations of the Free Tier. Benefits of the Premium Subscription currently include:

Unlimited active projects.

Cloud Sync & Backup for your project data via your iCloud account.

Access to AI-powered chat assistance and project generation features ("AI Features").


Billing & Auto-Renewal: Premium Subscriptions are purchased via Apple App Store In-App Purchase and are billed on a recurring basis (e.g., annually at [e.g., $14.99 USD], subject to local currency and taxes) as selected by you. Your Premium Subscription will automatically renew at the end of each subscription period unless you cancel it through your App Store account settings at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. All payments are processed by Apple, and you are subject to Apple's In-App Purchase terms.

Cancellation: You may cancel your Premium Subscription at any time through your Apple App Store account settings. Cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing period. No refunds are provided for partial subscription periods, except as required by applicable law or Apple's policies.

Price Changes: We reserve the right to change the subscription fees for Premium Subscriptions. We will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any price changes. Your continued use of the Premium Subscription after the price change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified subscription fee.

5. Use of AI Features (Gemini API)

Certain features of the App, available primarily to Premium Subscription users, utilize third-party Large Language Model APIs (e.g., Google's Gemini API) to provide AI-powered assistance ("AI Features").

User Input: To use AI Features, you may provide text or voice input. This input will be transmitted to the third-party AI service provider for processing to generate a response. Your use of these AI Features is subject to our Privacy Policy regarding data handling.

Disclaimer for AI Output: AI-generated content, suggestions, plans, or any other output from AI Features are provided for informational and planning assistance purposes only. We make no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy, completeness, suitability, reliability, or appropriateness of any AI-generated output. You are solely responsible for reviewing, verifying, and evaluating the AI output before relying on it for any purpose. We are not liable for any errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in AI-generated content, nor for any decisions or actions you take based on such content.

Fair Use of AI Features: You agree to use the AI Features in a fair and reasonable manner, consistent with personal DIY project planning. You agree not to:

Use automated scripts, bots, or other non-manual methods to access or make excessive requests to the AI Features.

Attempt to overload, disrupt, or impair the AI Features or underlying API services.

Use the AI Features for generating spam, illegal content, infringing content, or for any purpose unrelated to personal DIY project management.

We reserve the right to monitor usage of the AI Features and, at our sole discretion, to temporarily or permanently suspend or terminate your access to the AI Features or your Premium Subscription, without refund, if we detect patterns of use that we deem abusive, excessive, or in violation of these Terms.

6. User-Generated Content
You are solely responsible for all data, information, text, photos, notes, and other content ("User Content") that you create, upload, or store using the App. You retain all ownership rights to your User Content. By using the App, you grant us a limited license to access, use, store, and process your User Content solely to the extent necessary to provide and improve the Services, including storing data for your projects and transmitting data to third-party AI services as described in Section 5 and our Privacy Policy.

7. Cloud Sync & Backup (Premium Feature)
If you subscribe to a Premium Subscription that includes Cloud Sync & Backup, this feature utilizes Apple's iCloud/CloudKit services to synchronize your project data across your enabled devices and maintain a backup. This service is dependent on your iCloud account functioning correctly and your device settings. While we endeavor to ensure the reliability of this feature, we are not responsible for data loss or synchronization errors that may occur due to issues with iCloud/CloudKit services, your internet connection, or your device.

8. Prohibited Conduct
You agree not to use the App to:
* Violate any applicable local, state, national, or international law.
* Infringe upon or violate our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others.

Welcome!

Thank you for using DIY Project Planner! We're here to help you get the most out of planning and managing your projects.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Q: How do I create a new project using the AI Assistant?
A:

Navigate to the "Gemini Assistant" or "Chat" tab in the app.
You can type or use voice input (if enabled).
Clearly describe the project you want to create. For example: "Start a new project called 'Build Backyard Shed'. My budget is $1200. Initial tasks are: get permits, buy lumber, and level ground."
The AI will process your request and may ask for clarifications or show you a summary of the project it's about to create.
Confirm the details, and the AI will create the project, tasks, and other relevant items in the app.
Q: I've subscribed to Premium, but my features (like unlimited projects or Cloud Sync) don't seem to be active. What should I do?
A:

Please ensure you have a stable internet connection.
Go to the app's Settings screen.
Look for a "Restore Purchases" button and tap it. This will re-communicate with the App Store to verify your active subscription.
If Cloud Sync is a feature, ensure it's toggled on in Settings after restoring.
If the issue persists after trying to restore, please restart the app. If it's still not working, contact us using the email below.
Q: How do I add an expense or a material to a specific task using the AI Assistant?
A:

Make sure you have the relevant project open or tell the AI which project you're referring to (e.g., "For my 'Backyard Shed' project...").
You can then say or type something like:
"Add an expense: $75 for nails at Hardware Store X, for the task 'Build Frame'."
"Add material: 10 bags of concrete mix to the 'Level Ground' task."
The AI should confirm and add the item, linking it appropriately. You can then find it in the Budget or Materials section of that task or project.
