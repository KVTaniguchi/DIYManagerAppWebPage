Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Q: How do I create a new project using the AI Assistant?
A:

Navigate to the "Gemini Assistant" or "Chat" tab in the app.
You can type or use voice input (if enabled).
Clearly describe the project you want to create. For example: "Start a new project called 'Build Backyard Shed'. My budget is $1200. Initial tasks are: get permits, buy lumber, and level ground."
The AI will process your request and may ask for clarifications or show you a summary of the project it's about to create.
Confirm the details, and the AI will create the project, tasks, and other relevant items in the app.
Q: I've subscribed to Premium, but my features (like unlimited projects or Cloud Sync) don't seem to be active. What should I do?
A:

Please ensure you have a stable internet connection.
Go to the app's Settings screen.
Look for a "Restore Purchases" button and tap it. This will re-communicate with the App Store to verify your active subscription.
If Cloud Sync is a feature, ensure it's toggled on in Settings after restoring.
If the issue persists after trying to restore, please restart the app. If it's still not working, contact us using the email below.
Q: How do I add an expense or a material to a specific task using the AI Assistant?
A:

Make sure you have the relevant project open or tell the AI which project you're referring to (e.g., "For my 'Backyard Shed' project...").
You can then say or type something like:
"Add an expense: $75 for nails at Hardware Store X, for the task 'Build Frame'."
"Add material: 10 bags of concrete mix to the 'Level Ground' task."
The AI should confirm and add the item, linking it appropriately. You can then find it in the Budget or Materials section of that task or project.
